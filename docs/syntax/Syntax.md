# KLang Docs | Syntax

The syntax in KLang is very similar to C++. In fact, it is so similar to C++ that you can (most of the time) use C++ syntax highlighting for it.

## Hello, World!

This is the source code for the KLang Hello World program.

```c++

#include <io>

int main() {
    io::print("Hello, world!");
    return 0;
}
```
