# KLang Docs | Strings

KLang strings are like almost all other programming languages in that apostrophes and quotes can surround strings.

## Example:

### Good Code

`string x = "blah blah blah"`

### Bad Code

`string x = blah blah blah`

### Multi-Line Strings

Strings can be multiple lines. This can be helpful for the lua::call() function where you may want to use multiple line strings for simplicity.

```
[[
    Yay this
    is
    a multiple-
    line string.
]]
```

Multi-line strings can also be in one line.

```
[[ Multi-line string that only takes up one line ]]
```
